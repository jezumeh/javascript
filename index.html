		<h1>Hi, I'm Jesus</h1>
		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I'm excited to be in this class, Beginning Web Programming. I have been in-and-out of school while working since 2017. The schoolwork, side projects, and professional work I have done primarily touched on social media content design, front-end web design, and graphic design. For fun and relaxation, I enjoy [re-]binging movies/series (latest watch: Dune, 2021 and Dune II, 2024) while playing PC games (usually Minecraft).</p>
        <p>I am taking "Beginning Web Programming" because:</p>
		<ul>
            <li>it is a class in my A.A.S. Digital Art and Design degree program,</li>
            <li>it is a class in my Digital Interface Design pathway, and</li>
            <li>I want to pick up skills that will help me becoming a better digital marketing specialist.</li>
        </ul>
