			<h1 class="hdg">About Me</h1>
			<p>I'm excited to be in this class, <!--wk3. include span--><span class="course">Beginning Web Programming</span>. I have been in-and-out of school while working since 2017. The schoolwork, side projects, and professional work I have done primarily touched on social media content design, front-end web design, and graphic design. For fun and relaxation, I enjoy [re-]binging movies/series (latest watch: Dune, 2021 and Dune II, 2024) while playing PC games (usually Minecraft).</p>

			<p class="hdg">I am taking "Beginning Web Programming" because:</p>

			<ul>
			<li>it is a class in my A.A.S. Digital Art and Design degree program,</li>
			<li>it is a class in my Digital Interface Design pathway, and</li>
			<li>I want to pick up skills that will help me becoming a better digital marketing specialist.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<section id="professional-goals">
			<h1 class="hdg">Professional Goals</h1>
			<p>As an aspiring design researcher, I am driven to be community-oriented, resourceful, and energetic. I have planned, executed, and reflected on projects of narrow and wide scope: social media campaigns, mail ads, and communication audits to name a few.</p>

			<p>Presently, I am studying Digital Art and Design at Dallas College. It's a degree that complements my current work skills in design and digital marketing. I have even been able to pick a pathway in Digital Interface Design, which helps me build specialized skills.</p>

			<p>As a design researcher, I want to be a subject matter expert on accessibility. For me, that means studying and publishing best practices for inclusive language. While I intend to focus on copywriting, I want to join a and interdisciplinary research group where I am able to research designs for a wide scope of contexts.</p>
